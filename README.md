# my-learning-path
where I put all of my tests and tries.

As I take a look at my situation, it's a kind of struggle to spare some time to focus on learning new skills and get into starting a new apprenticeship, 
so I can finally change the wrong path I took in my working career. But I will take the challenge because I don't have any choice left to turn at. 

Did I tell you about what changes I brought in with this Git-Commit? Nope. So, I just added a description of my actual set of mind.
